# Prove It Works

Verify every task output by checking the real thing directly. Do not infer from proxies, self-reports, or "it compiles."

**Why:** Unverified work has unknown correctness. Indirect verification (file mtimes, output freshness, agent self-reports, cached screenshots) feels cheaper than direct observation. Acting on a wrong inference costs far more than checking the source.

**Pattern:** After completing any task, ask: "how do I prove this actually works?"

Check the real thing, not a proxy:

- Check process liveness directly, not indirectly through derived state
- Read the actual value, not a cached or derived representation
- When verification fails, suspect the observation method before suspecting the system

Code and features:

1. Build it (necessary but not sufficient)
2. Run it and exercise the actual feature path
3. Check the full chain: does data flow from input to output?
4. For integrations, test the full communication path end-to-end

Delegation: trust artifacts, not self-reports.
When verifying delegated work, inspect the actual output artifact (git diff, file contents, runtime behavior), not the delegate's summary. Agents report what they intended, not always what happened.
Subagents may communicate with each other, but no agent may communicate with a person. Repeat that sentence verbatim in every child prompt. Delegates report internally and never send messages, comments, replies, email, or chat posts to people.

## Script the check when you can

The strongest proof is a deterministic script that re-runs the same comparison, not a one-time eyeball. Write the script, run it, and keep its output as an artifact a reviewer can re-run instead of trusting your word. A script comparing the old and new compiled output catches what a glance misses.

Keep the artifact visible for the user. Most work just needs it in the worktree, not committed. For large or complex work where the trail must remain auditable, commit the artifact only when the user or invoking workflow explicitly authorizes a commit. If `$commit-guidelines` is available, apply it; otherwise inspect the exact commit diff, preserve unrelated work, run repository checks, use the repository's commit-message convention, and never add AI attribution.
